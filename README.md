Starter:
Biggest, Smallest and Average
Here’s a list of numbers: 
numsList = [7, 6, 23, 8.18, 18, 8, 7.2, 85, 915, 12]

Output the biggest number, the smallest number and the average of all the numbers. 
For the biggest and smallest numbers, also output the position they are at in the list. 

Same Start and End
Here’s a list of strings:
stringsList = [“abc”, “123”, “2332”, “aBBA”, “heelloo”, “1212”, “DcEfD”]

Output the number of strings that have the same character at the start and end. 
In this problem, ‘A’ and ‘a’ are the same characters (technically)

Hint: strings are a list of characters. 

List of (good) Cereals
Allow the user to input a cereal. 
If the cereal is not ‘sultana and bran’ or ‘weetbix’, then add the cereal to a list called ‘cerealList’. (Doesn’t matter if there’s double-ups of cereal)
Once the user inputs any of the very much hated cereals, end the program and output cerealList. 
Input Example
Output Example
Enter Cereal: Cheerios
Enter Cereal: Nutri Grain
Enter Cereal: Cinnamon Toast Crunch
Enter Cereal: Corn Flakes
Enter Cereal: Weetbix
[‘Cheerios’, ‘Nutri Grain’, ‘Cinnamon Toast Crunch’, ‘Corn Flakes’]
